Overview
* Inspired by KOL/Harvestmoon/?
* Takes place on a space station or crashed space ship
* Set length quest that you repeat for speed, gaining skills in a meta game

General Notes
* Go to a place to get some macguffins, can only carry back some at a time
* Each one you can use to teleport back and gain another skill
* Or build up town with macguffins, then you can use them as currency for items/skills
* Carrying capacity is limited
* Survival is important- making sure you have enough food, shelter, etc
* Robot companion to send back items?
* Start in populated town with a plot of land for stuff, slowly

Plot
* Space station is huge but failing due to something, need to recover these energy pods or whatever
* Supplies need to be reset every time you get something for the speedrun aspect to work

Farm
* Start on farm, initial part of the game is growing stuff to get supplies for the trip

Robots
* Get a companion with various trade offs like carrying capacity vs speed going back to town vs utility in other things

Shelter
* Different types of shelter to carry- weight trade offs
* Different places might have different types of bonuses, interact with type of shelter

(so far this has been an interesting framework to set up something like KOL where you have different ways to optimize different stats and items)
Obstacles- "Nature"
* cliff
  * possible solutions: ladder (uses wood, weight), jetpack (uses fuel, weight)
  * relevant stats: carpentry if you want to make the ladder right there, piloting for jetpack
* chasm
  * possible solutions: bridge (uses wood, weight), jetpack (uses fuel, weight)
  * relevant stats: same
* river
  * possible solutions: bridge (uses wood, weight), jetpack (uses fuel, weight), boat (similar to jetpack but no fuel, can maybe also be used to travel along river)
  * relevant stats: same, some other skill for boats
* door
  * explosives, lockpick, "knowledge", brute force
  * relevant stats: intelligence, strength etc
