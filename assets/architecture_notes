items need to do things when you activate them
need a simple scripting language
could be JS but that might be repetitive?
maybe could call into set of JS functions?
["triggerEvent", "hoe"]
["writeFlag", "quest5", "done"]
and so on
then I'd have actions = {}
actions.triggerEvent = blah
could combine with action queue and just support synchronous actions

All items (inventory and world, probably not player itself) should be defined in items DB
Goal is that work is mostly done in inkscape + sprite editor + world editor + item editor
