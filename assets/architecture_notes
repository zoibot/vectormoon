items need to do things when you activate them
need a simple scripting language
could be JS but that might be repetitive?
maybe could call into set of JS functions?
["triggerEvent", "hoe"]
["writeFlag", "quest5", "done"]
and so on
then I'd have actions = {}
actions.triggerEvent = blah
could combine with action queue and just support synchronous actions

All items (inventory and world, probably not player itself) should be defined in items DB
Goal is that work is mostly done in inkscape + sprite editor + world editor + item editor

Need to think about items vs objects -> definitely lean toward items
think about objects -> which ones should really be items?
ui etc need to be objects, but maybe "fixed", "npc", and "plot" could be items

=====

Having objects have state like position and rotation that is separate and passed in to the graphics is getting to be a pain, since it makes it harder to do things like "contains" and get a bounding box. I could have some sort of shared property bag but that doesn't seem too great either. I need to really think about what the different objects are here and how to divide up responsibilities and state.
