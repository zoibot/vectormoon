Concrete TODOs
- convert JS items to JSON items + JS actions
- make level editor load levels

BUGS
- moving between maps is off
- door is messed up

tools
- level editor
- items editor

game engine
- create a shop
- component based objects

content
 - exploration
 - how does this work as far as randomness and such?
 - portals could have randomness in them- how to keep it consistent?

items
- terrarium
- camp/sleeping
- better item scripting (how to store in DB?)

infrastructure
- render things to offscreen canvas to improve performance
- switch to require
- move items to a db?
- crunch data (maps and items)

server
- create "state" system, decide when to update server with state, etc
- how to define certain object properties as state
- start creating tables, defining interface
- all actions sent to server
- most stuff will just be server validation and acceptance but I could keep some logic on the server if I wanted to keep it secret-ish
